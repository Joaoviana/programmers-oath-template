## First Promise: 

I will not produce harmful code. 
I will not intentionally write code with bugs.

This means: Do your best.

[the first promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIIJzAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D36NgPu9OyRM&usg=AOvVaw0ou3BcQNAflHJjk6fPJw7c)

## Second Promise:

The code that I produce will always be my best work. I will not knowingly allow code that is defective either in behavior or structure to accumulate.

This means: Refactoring, reading and continuously going over your code and finding new ways to make it maintainable is a key factor. 

[the second promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIIKjAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzTQ-KZB69Y0&usg=AOvVaw2IMtKImCx2O8Rm59w6VT6s)

## Third Promise: 
I will produce, with each release, a quick, sure, and repeatable proof that every element of the code works as it should.

This means: Testing the produced code.

[the third promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=10&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIIQjAJ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DsNWCmdDlmSQ&usg=AOvVaw2-KiiVggXXbYeRObWxD_r2)

___

## Fourth Promise:

I will make frequent, small, releases so that I do not impede the progress of others.

This means: be assertive and conscious about the content and progress update of your releases, always focusing on the co-working environment you are set into. Short term rapid releases.


[the fourth promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=5&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIIMzAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWCYlSn3PtRI&usg=AOvVaw08q1MIhJnGjRy10BEm5pjk)

___

## Fifth Promise:

I will fearlessly and relentlessly improve my creations at every opportunity. I will never degrade them.

This means: I will never make the code worse.

[the fifth promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=9&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIIPzAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqEeYlLmrHOc&usg=AOvVaw1yiXH31qYs202Vv6feV5Qs)

## Sixth Promise:

I will do all that I can to keep the productivity of myself, and others, as high as possible. I will do nothing that decreases that productivity.

This means: well, what was just stated above. 

[the sixth promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=7&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIIOTAG&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWQMku1-fDYo&usg=AOvVaw0gaYBLsB7tkoj5DVLMS-gI)

[TOP](#the-programmers-oath)

___

## Seventh Promise:

I will continuously ensure that others can cover for me, and that I can cover for them.

This means: my code and its intentions should be clear to others reading it. This covers always the responsibility of others in order to make the changes made visible and easy to understand.

[the seventh promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=6&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIINjAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3sU_zcebQwI&usg=AOvVaw3SQJUCL9yJUUjwhZOEHxYx)

___

## Eighth Promise:

I will produce estimates that are honest both in magnitude and precision. I will not make promises without certainty.

Well, this is kind of a difficult skill to have. To produce estimates is something that needs to be learnt through time and experience, depending on th magnitude of the task/project in case. In order to be certain of what I am ask to do I have to be precise on my estimations, rather than finding straight away an exact deadline. From my novice/beginner perspective, my deadlines would be stated on a short term. 

[the eighth promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=6&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIINjAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3sU_zcebQwI&usg=AOvVaw3SQJUCL9yJUUjwhZOEHxYx)

## Ninth Promise:

I will never stop learning and improving my craft.

This means: read, read, read and read. Plenty of resources online and on actual books give us no excuse to not improve ourselves, widen our knowledge and become a better programmer each day. 

[the ninth promise](https://www.google.be/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=video&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjCirufkZnaAhUMjqQKHQxPDyQQtwIILTAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DINNvxAV8AQU&usg=AOvVaw0OT0Xnhl9K3GtnqVPQEleM)
